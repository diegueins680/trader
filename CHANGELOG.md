# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
- Strategy defaults: enable cost-aware edge + confidence sizing by default, add `--no-cost-aware-edge`/`--no-confidence-sizing` opt-outs, and raise baseline risk filters (min SNR, trend lookback, hold/cooldown/max-hold, vol target/floor/max-vol, Kalman z-min, min position size).

- Live bot: auto-syncs to the latest top combo (poll interval `TRADER_BOT_COMBOS_POLL_SEC`) and applies it while running.
- Live bot: always adopts existing positions on startup (`botAdoptExistingPosition` is now implicit).
- Live bot: startup waits for the top combo compatible with adopted positions or open orders before running.
- Live bot: `/bot/start` auto-adopts orphan open futures positions when a matching top combo exists.

- Web UI: when trading is armed, automatically switches Market to Futures when Positioning is set to Long/Short.
- Web UI: falls back to `GET` for async polling when `POST` hits proxy errors (e.g. 502/503).
- Web UI: avoid optimizer combo apply crashes when compute limits are unavailable.
- Backtests: risk halts now record `MAX_DRAWDOWN`/`MAX_DAILY_LOSS` as trade exit reasons.
- Backtests: risk halts now evaluate post-bar equity and can close positions at the bar close.
- Backtests: `agreementOk` now counts open-direction agreement only when both models emit a direction.

- Trading: daily-loss halts reset at UTC day boundaries when bar timestamps are available (exchange/CSV timestamps; otherwise interval-based).
- Trading: entries gated by `--min-signal-to-noise`, `--max-volatility`, or `--vol-target` now wait for a volatility estimate.
- Trading: latest signals now apply the same volatility gating and confidence close-direction gating (including blend) as backtests.

- Backtests: add volatility-targeted rebalancing (`--rebalance-bars`, `--rebalance-threshold`) and optional funding/borrow drag (`--funding-rate`).
- Backtests: `--backtest-ratio` now errors if the split leaves too few training/backtest bars (no silent clamping).
- Live bot: risk halts now record `MAX_DRAWDOWN`/`MAX_DAILY_LOSS` exit reasons even if a signal exit coincides.
- Kalman market context now honors small `--kalman-market-top-n` values when enough symbols are available.
- Tuning: sweep/optimization validates prediction lengths before scoring to avoid crashes.
- Trading/Tuning: add blend method, min-edge/cost-aware edge gating, max-hold exits, trend/volatility sizing filters, and stress-weighted tune scoring.
- Trading: max-hold exits now enforce a 1-bar cooldown before re-entry.
- Trading: add signal-to-noise entry filter plus volatility-multiple stop-loss/take-profit/trailing options.
- Normalization: `minmax`/`standard` fall back to no-op when the fit window is empty or only contains non-finite values; `log` now falls back to no-op when the fit window is empty or contains non-finite/non-positive values.
- Predictors: conformal intervals now calibrate on a holdout split; predictor training validates feature dimensions and fails fast on mismatches.
- Predictors: conformal sigma is omitted when calibration is empty or interval width is invalid; quantile sigma is omitted when q10/q90 are invalid or identical.
- Predictors: conformal sigma now derives from alpha with a conformal quantile rank; quantile medians are clamped inside q10/q90.
- Predictors: training now excludes the calibration split for all models to avoid leakage.
- Predictors: skip GBDT/quantile/conformal outputs when the feature dataset is empty to avoid crashes.
- Predictors: feature windows now drop zero-price returns and use sample variance for volatility features.
- Predictors: add a lightweight benchmark harness (`trader-bench`) for quick performance checks.

- Web UI: hides the Agree overlay for LSTM-only backtests and clarifies bars=0 combo behavior.
- Web UI: optimizer combo refresh errors keep the last known combos visible with a warning.
- API/Trading: latest signals include `closeDirection`, and live order decisions respect `closeThreshold` for exits.
- Web UI: manual Method/open/close edits are preserved when optimizer combos or optimize/sweep results apply.
- Web UI: optimizer combos now persist/show the operations that produced each top result on hover.
- Web UI: add auto-apply toggle with last-applied marker, manual override lock/unlock hints, and a cross-origin API base warning.
- Web UI: show persisted live-bot snapshots when `/bot/status` is restored after restart.
- Live bot/UI: `/bot/status` includes `startingReason` and the UI surfaces when startup is waiting for a compatible top combo.
- API: `/bot/status` now caps the `tail` parameter to 5000 points.
- API: enforce `TRADER_API_MAX_BODY_BYTES` for request payloads (default 1048576 bytes).
- API: `/optimizer/run` responses now truncate stdout/stderr to `TRADER_API_MAX_OPTIMIZER_OUTPUT_BYTES` (default 20000 bytes).
- API: classify internal `ErrorCall` failures as server errors instead of client errors.
- Optimizer: S3-persisted top combos are merged into new optimizer runs to keep best-ever results.
- Predictors: guard empty TCN dilations to avoid crashes.
- API: `/bot/start` error responses include per-symbol errors when all requested symbols fail.

- Optimizer: adds a `--quality` preset plus CSV high/low auto-detection for deeper equity searches.
- Optimizer: adds trade-quality filters (win rate, profit factor, exposure) and samples min-hold/cooldown bars for churn control.
- Optimizer: adds min-signal-to-noise sampling plus Sharpe/walk-forward Sharpe filters, with `/optimizer/run` fields to match.
- Optimizer: adds walk-forward/tune-stress sampling controls and propagates additional combo parameters (vol floors, vol caps, stress settings) through top-combo outputs.
- Optimizer: auto optimizer biases long-short sampling to match existing open positions/orders so compatible combos appear sooner.
- Optimizer: adds sampling ranges for max-hold bars, blend weight, entry gating (incl. cost-aware-edge probability), position/vol sizing (incl. vol-floor/max-volatility/periods-per-year), Kalman market-top-n, tune objective passthrough, and bars auto/distribution controls.
- Optimizer/API: expose intrabar fill probability, bracket-stop ranges (incl. vol-mult), confidence gating, and LSTM training sampling controls to `/optimizer/run`.
- LSTM: persistence keys now include exchange platform to avoid cross-exchange weight reuse.
- Optimizer: raise the default `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_MAX_COMBOS` cap to 200 and archive top-combos snapshots locally/S3 for history.
- API: `/optimizer/run` now accepts the expanded optimizer sampling, tune-objective, and Kalman/volatility sizing parameters.
- API: `/optimizer/run` now merges optimizer runs into `top-combos.json` (bounded by `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_MAX_COMBOS`).
- API: allow `/optimizer/combos` to persist top-combos.json via `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_COMBOS_DIR`.
- API: persist `/bot/status` snapshots via `TRADER_BOT_STATE_DIR` so the last state survives restarts.

- Deploy: Docker image and quick AWS deploy default `TRADER_STATE_DIR` to `/var/lib/trader/state` (now configurable via `deploy-aws-quick.sh --state-dir`).
- Deploy: when using CloudFront with a distribution ID, the quick AWS deploy script sets the UI API base to `/api` to avoid CORS.
- Deploy: quick AWS deploy now prints the CloudFront domain and warns when `/api/*` behavior is missing.
- API: rounds `/binance/keys` test order quantities to the symbol step size to avoid precision errors.
- API/UI: `/binance/keys` trade probes report `skipped` when no test order is attempted, and the UI shows `SKIP` instead of `FAIL`.
- API: `/binance/keys` preflight checks minNotional when price data is available and only fetches symbol filters when needed.
- API: add `/coinbase/keys` for Coinbase API key checks (includes passphrase).
- API: enables async job persistence by default (local `.tmp/async`); set `TRADER_API_ASYNC_DIR` to override or disable.
- Exchange data: Poloniex candles now use the `/markets/{symbol}/candles` API with `BASE_QUOTE` symbols (legacy `QUOTE_BASE` is auto-swapped).
