# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
- Ops: move persistence to PostgreSQL (`TRADER_DB_URL`/`DATABASE_URL`), storing `symbol`, `orderId`, and `comboUuid` for each operation.
- Combos: persist top-combo metrics/params to PostgreSQL with `strategies` and `combo_parameters` tables plus per-combo operation counts.
- Binance: `/binance/keys` quote sizing falls back to mark price, 24h last price, and the latest 1m close when ticker price is unavailable.
- Binance: `/binance/keys` trims dataset-style suffixes from `binanceSymbol` before running the trade test.
- Binance: `/binance/keys` futures signed probe now uses the futures balance endpoint to avoid invalid-symbol errors.
- Optimizer: include stable combo UUIDs in top-combos outputs.
- Optimizer: merge top-combos de-duplication now keys off full combo identity (params + thresholds + objective + source) so new variants persist.

- Deploy: quick AWS UI config auto-fills `apiFallbackUrl` only for `/api` mode (it points at the API URL when known).
- Deploy: quick AWS deploy can resolve the UI CloudFront distribution + bucket from a domain via `TRADER_UI_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN`/`--cloudfront-domain`, and reads `.env.deploy` (or `TRADER_DEPLOY_ENV_FILE`) for defaults.
- Optimizer: replace the Python optimizer scripts with Haskell executables (`optimize-equity`, `merge-top-combos`) and route `/optimizer/run` through them.
- Optimizer: `/optimizer/run` JSON parsing accepts numeric strings (including `nan`/`inf`) for legacy compatibility.
- Optimizer: JSON outputs use stable key ordering for deterministic diffs.
- Optimizer: top-combos now stamp `params.binanceSymbol` for CSV runs (auto-derived from `--symbol-label` or filename) and backfill missing `metrics.annualizedReturn`.
- Optimizer: add seeding/exploitation controls, new quality filters (annualized return/calmar/turnover), and funding/rebalance sampling parameters.
- Optimizer: Calmar objective falls back to annualized return when max drawdown is zero.
- Optimizer: always refresh at least the top 5 combos with latest backtests, even when equity drops.
- Optimizer: each new live-bot candle attempts top-5 combo backtests to refresh operations.
- Optimizer: rank top combos by annualized equity (`annualizedReturn`) so the #1 combo is the highest annualized equity.
- Optimizer: apply top-combo order sizing (`orderQuantity`, `orderQuote`, `orderQuoteFraction`, `maxOrderQuote`) in the UI/API and ensure bundled combos include symbols and sizing defaults so orders can execute.
- Live bot: API auto-starts for `TRADER_BOT_SYMBOLS` (or `--binance-symbol`) with trading enabled by default and restarts on the next poll interval if stopped.
- Live bot: auto-start keeps bots running for the current top 10 combos from `top-combos.json` (Binance only), prioritizing higher annualized equity (`metrics.annualizedReturn`) with trade count as a tie-breaker.
- Live bot: auto-start warns when fewer than 10 unique top-combo symbols are available to start all top-combo bots.
- Live bot: top-combo sync treats interval-less combos as compatible with the current interval.
- Live bot: attempt an order on every candle based on the desired position (even when holding).
- Observability: log Binance API requests (`binance.request`) and minute-by-minute bot status snapshots (`bot.status`), plus a live/offline timeline chart in the UI.
- Observability: redact Binance query params in ops logs even when the query string starts with `?`.
- Observability: ensure ops logging covers all Binance API calls (including listenKey/trades/positions/data fetches) and emit an immediate `bot.status` snapshot on bot start.
- Trading: when confidence sizing is enabled, scale live orders and backtests by LSTM confidence (thresholds now configurable).
- Trading: LSTM confidence sizing now uses the method-selected prediction stream (Kalman/LSTM/blend/router) for live orders to match backtests.
- Live bot: equity/drawdown tracking now respects sized positions and scales fees by position size.
- Trading: `--lstm-confidence-soft 0` disables the half-size step so LSTM sizing becomes binary at the hard threshold.
- Trading: futures order placement checks available balance (and leverage) before submitting.
- Trading: floor entry order sizes to exchange minimums (minQty/step/minNotional) when possible and treat dust-sized balances as flat to avoid zero-quantity orders.
- Trading: add `--method router` with `--router-lookback`/`--router-min-score` for adaptive Kalman/LSTM/blend selection.
- Trading: router signals apply Kalman confidence/risk gates only on Kalman-selected bars.
- Backtests: router threshold sweeps use routed predictions when `method=router` is selected.
- Backtests: router scoring now uses the effective open threshold (including cost-aware min-edge floors).
- Backtests: router agreement rate now reflects Kalman vs LSTM agreement instead of routed predictions.
- Optimizer: `--optimize-operations` now evaluates `router` when selecting the best method/threshold combo.
- Optimization: default `optimizeOperations`/`sweepThreshold` scoring now uses `ecPeriodsPerYear` for annualized objectives.
- Trading: add tri-layer exits on slow Kalman crosses, optional Kalman-band exits, and a strong LSTM flip-exit toggle.
- Trading: LSTM flip exits now apply only to LSTM-based methods (`11`/`01`).
- Trading: require a slow-line cross for tri-layer exits, trigger Kalman-band exits on candle high/low hits, and disable band sampling when the lookback is < 2.
- Trading: allow Kalman-band exits without `--tri-layer` when the band flags are enabled.
- Trading: apply `--min-position-size` only as a final size floor, not as a confidence gate.
- Trading: align LSTM prediction indexing to bar positions and trim meta gating inputs consistently.
- Trading: skip confirmation/width gates when the corresponding predictor outputs are missing.
- Trading: rebalancing now requires non-zero `--rebalance-bars` and `--rebalance-threshold`, and resets honor the latest same-side signal anchor.
- Trading: add dynamic threshold-factor multipliers for open/close thresholds and min-edge/min-signal-to-noise, with CLI/optimizer tuning (forces tune objective to annualized equity when enabled).
- Backtests: `--max-daily-loss` now errors when open timestamp vectors do not match the closes series instead of falling back to interval-based day keys.
- Backtests: daily-loss now honors timestamp vectors even when interval seconds are unavailable.
- Backtests: invalid CSV time values now error instead of silently disabling time-based day keys.
- Backtests: `--max-daily-loss` errors when day keys cannot be derived from timestamps or interval seconds.
- Metrics: round trips now exclude end-of-series `EOD` exits (affects `--min-round-trips` and tie-breakers).
- Predictors: fall back to the GBDT base prediction when feature dimensions mismatch.
- Predictors: skip transformer/quantile outputs on feature dimension mismatches instead of crashing, and use the clamped median for the quantile sensor mean.
- Predictors: clamp feature windows to the available lookback so short lookbacks still produce datasets.
- Predictors: TCN skips zero-price lags and scales kernel size for small lookback windows to avoid overreaching lag requirements.
- Predictors: derive HMM/TCN training cutoffs from the last usable feature index to avoid truncating valid history when feature rows drop.
- Predictors: quantile SGD uses a zero-gradient on exact ties to avoid bias.
- CLI/API: `predictors` rejects mixes of `all` and `none`.
- CLI/API: validate `--min-position-size <= --max-position-size`.
- CLI: when optimizing/sweeping thresholds, print a tip for `--tune-objective annualized-equity`.
- Predictors: add `--predictors` (CLI/API `predictors`) to select which predictors train/use; disabled predictors skip their confirmation gates.
- Web UI: default order sizing uses `orderQuote=100` to avoid orders rounding to zero on common minQty/step sizes.
- Backtests: API queues requests when the backtest slot is busy; UI waits and notifies when the backtest completes.
- Strategy defaults: move to `--interval 1h`/`--lookback-window 7d`, raise baseline risk filters (min SNR, trend lookback, hold/cooldown/max-hold, max position size, vol target/floor/max-vol, Kalman z-min, min position size), and bump cost assumptions (fee/slippage/spread).
- Strategy defaults: enable cost-aware edge, conformal/quantile confirmations, and confidence sizing by default, with `--no-cost-aware-edge`, `--no-confirm-conformal`, `--no-confirm-quantiles`, and `--no-confidence-sizing` opt-outs.
- Optimizer defaults: switch to `equity-dd-turnover` with higher drawdown/turnover penalties, longer lookback windows, and 1h-1d interval sampling.
- Observability: add Discord-compatible webhook notifications for bot/trade events via `TRADER_WEBHOOK_URL` (filter with `TRADER_WEBHOOK_EVENTS`).
- Live bot: support multi-symbol bots via `botSymbols` and `TRADER_BOT_SYMBOLS`, with per-symbol status snapshots.
- Live bot: auto-syncs to the latest top combo (poll interval `TRADER_BOT_COMBOS_POLL_SEC`) and applies it while running.
- Live bot: always adopts existing positions on startup (`botAdoptExistingPosition` is now implicit).
- Live bot: adopt existing positions immediately on startup, applying a compatible top combo when available (no blocking wait).
- Live bot: `/bot/start` auto-adopts orphan open futures positions even when no matching top combo is available.
- Live bot: auto-start loop now adopts orphan open futures positions when a matching top combo exists (no UI or `/bot/start` required).
- Live bot: cache Binance API keys in running bot state so order operations keep working without UI key forwarding.
- Live bot/API: futures position checks now respect hedge-mode sides; bot start/adoption and futures trade requests reject simultaneous long+short positions for the same symbol.
- Ops: add a cron watchdog script to keep the live bot running (`deploy/ensure-bot-running.sh`).
- Ops: fix the cron watchdog JSON parsing in zsh so `/bot/status` checks succeed.
- Ops: cron watchdog treats `starting` bots as healthy; status checks prefer `TRADER_BOT_SYMBOLS`/`TRADER_BOT_SYMBOL` and fall back to start payload symbols.
- Ops: include `binanceSymbol` in multi-symbol watchdog start payloads to satisfy API data-source validation.

- Metrics: agreement rate now counts only bars where both models emit a direction (warm-up/no-signal bars excluded).
- Metrics: annualization now derives from parsed interval seconds when available instead of defaulting to 365 for unknown intervals.
- Backtests: validate open timestamp vectors against closes to avoid misaligned day boundaries.
- Web UI: Binance account trades time filters accept unix ms timestamps or ISO-8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM).
- Web UI: validate symbol formats per platform and require non-negative Binance trades From ID inputs.
- Web UI: fall back to platform default symbols when saved symbols are missing/invalid, and highlight trade-test skip reasons.
- Web UI: live bot controls support multi-symbol start/stop and per-bot selection.
- Web UI: block live bot start when trading is armed but Binance keys are missing or unverified (use Check keys or switch to paper mode).
- Web UI: ensure live bot starts include a primary symbol when using multi-symbol requests so `/bot/start` validation succeeds.
- Web UI: warn when the bot status timeline range falls outside available ops history.
- Web UI: send explicit zero/false values for default-on risk settings so disable toggles take effect.

- Optimizer: S3-persisted top combos are merged into new optimizer runs to keep best-ever results.
- Optimizer: threshold sweeps now prefer higher open/close thresholds when scores tie.
- Optimizer: `top-combos.json` now includes a `bestOptimizationTechniques` list summarizing recommended search approaches and records which techniques were applied (Sobol seeding, successive halving, Bayesian-style exploitation, walk-forward validation, ensemble summary).
- Predictors: guard empty TCN dilations to avoid crashes.
- API: `/bot/start` error responses include per-symbol errors when all requested symbols fail.
- Web UI: live bot start/status errors surface CloudFront `/api/*` proxy hints and avoid a stuck `Starting...` state when the API is down.
- Web UI: add compact bot-state timeline charts for each running bot card.
- Live bot: support long/short positioning on Binance futures (including adopting/closing existing short positions).
- Optimizer: adds a `--quality` preset plus CSV high/low auto-detection for deeper equity searches.
- Optimizer: adds trade-quality filters (win rate, profit factor, exposure) and samples min-hold/cooldown bars for churn control.
- Optimizer: adds min-signal-to-noise sampling plus Sharpe/walk-forward Sharpe filters, with `/optimizer/run` fields to match.
- Optimizer: adds walk-forward/tune-stress sampling controls and propagates additional combo parameters (vol floors, vol caps, stress settings) through top-combo outputs.
- Optimizer: auto optimizer biases long-short sampling to match existing open positions/orders so compatible combos appear sooner.
- Optimizer: adds sampling ranges for max-hold bars, blend weight, entry gating (incl. cost-aware-edge probability), position/vol sizing (incl. vol-floor/max-volatility/periods-per-year), Kalman market-top-n, tune objective passthrough, and bars auto/distribution controls.
- Optimizer: add tri-layer cloud noise sampling (`--p-tri-layer`, `--tri-layer-fast-mult-min/max`, `--tri-layer-slow-mult-min/max`).
- Optimizer: when sampling default-on flags (cost-aware edge, conformal/quantile confirmation, confidence sizing), emit the matching `--no-*` flags so disables take effect.
- Trading: add tri-layer cloud slope/width/touch/body controls, LSTM flip exit grace bars, and configurable LSTM confidence thresholds.
- Optimizer/API: expose tri-layer cloud slope/width/touch/body ranges plus LSTM flip grace + confidence threshold sampling.
- Backtests: slice exchange open-time vectors for walk-forward folds to avoid length mismatches.
- Optimizer/API: expose intrabar fill probability, bracket-stop ranges (incl. vol-mult), confidence gating, and LSTM training sampling controls to `/optimizer/run`.
- Optimizer: threshold sweep tie-breakers now prefer higher final equity, then lower turnover/more round trips, and avoid inverted hysteresis unless equity is unchanged.
- Optimizer: top-combo merges rank by annualized equity (`annualizedReturn`), using score and final equity as tie-breakers.
- Optimizer: truncated trial errors now use the legacy ellipsis marker (`…`).
- Optimizer: accept numeric strings for backtest numeric fields and treat invalid threshold values as schema errors.
- Optimizer: pretty-printed JSON output now uses stable, sorted keys.
- LSTM: persistence keys now include exchange platform to avoid cross-exchange weight reuse.
- Optimizer: raise the default `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_MAX_COMBOS` cap to 200 and archive top-combos snapshots locally/S3 for history.
- API: `/optimizer/run` now accepts the expanded optimizer sampling, tune-objective, and Kalman/volatility sizing parameters.
- API: `/optimizer/run` now merges optimizer runs into `top-combos.json` (bounded by `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_MAX_COMBOS`).
- API: allow `/optimizer/combos` to persist top-combos.json via `TRADER_OPTIMIZER_COMBOS_DIR`.
- API: persist `/bot/status` snapshots via `TRADER_BOT_STATE_DIR` so the last state survives restarts.
- API: optionally persist bot snapshots + optimizer combos to S3 via `TRADER_STATE_S3_BUCKET`.
- API: add `TRADER_STATE_DIR` to persist ops/journal/bot state/optimizer combos/async jobs/LSTM weights under one shared directory.
- Deploy: Docker image and quick AWS deploy default `TRADER_STATE_DIR` to `/var/lib/trader/state` (now configurable via `deploy-aws-quick.sh --state-dir`).
- Deploy: when using CloudFront with a distribution ID, the quick AWS deploy script sets the UI API base to `/api` to avoid CORS.
- Deploy: quick AWS deploy now prints the CloudFront domain and warns when `/api/*` behavior is missing.
- API: rounds `/binance/keys` test order quantities to the symbol step size to avoid precision errors.
- API/UI: `/binance/keys` trade probes report `skipped` when no test order is attempted, and the UI shows `SKIP` instead of `FAIL`.
- API: `/binance/keys` preflight checks minNotional when price data is available and only fetches symbol filters when needed.
- API: add `/coinbase/keys` for Coinbase API key checks (includes passphrase).
- API: enables async job persistence by default (local `.tmp/async`); set `TRADER_API_ASYNC_DIR` to override or disable.
- Exchange data: Poloniex candles now use the `/markets/{symbol}/candles` API with `BASE_QUOTE` symbols (legacy `QUOTE_BASE` is auto-swapped).
