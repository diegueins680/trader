TRADING STRATEGIES
A "Tri-Layer" trading strategy combines the strengths of these 
three distinct tools to solve the "Noise vs. Lag vs. Prediction" 
problem.
• Kalman Filters act as your Map: They ﬁlter out noise to show 
the "true" trend and dynamic support/resistance.
• Price Action acts as your Trigger: It provides the precise 
timing to enter when the market respects your map.
• LSTM (AI) acts as your Compass/Filter: It predicts the future 
direction to tell you if the trade has a high probability of 
success, preventing you from buying into a "fake" support.
Here is a comprehensive guide to implementing this uniﬁed 
strategy for reputed cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
Phase 1: The Setup (The Indicators)
1. The Kalman Filter (Trend & Levels)
The Kalman Filter (KF) is superior to Moving Averages because it 
adjusts to volatility in real-time.
• Conﬁguration: You need a "Fast" KF (low noise 
measurement) and a "Slow" KF (high noise measurement).
• The "Trend Cloud": The space between the Fast and Slow 
KF lines forms a dynamic "cloud."
◦ Green Cloud (Fast > Slow): Bullish Trend. This zone 
acts as dynamic Support.
◦ Red Cloud (Fast < Slow): Bearish Trend. This zone acts 
as dynamic Resistance.
• Velocity (Slope): Calculate the slope of the Slow KF . If the 
slope is positive, momentum is up. If negative, momentum is 
down.

2. LSTM Model (The Predictor)
You don't need to code a complex neural network from scratch if 
you use pre-built libraries, but functionally, you need it to output 
two things:
• Directional Bias: A binary classiﬁcation (Will price be higher 
in 12/24 hours? Yes/No).
• Conﬁdence Interval: A probability score (e.g., "75% sure 
price will rise").
• Usage: Only take trades where the LSTM prediction aligns 
with your Kalman Trend.
Phase 2: Picking the Lows (Buying Strategy)
This strategy focuses on "Pullbacks" within a trend, which is the 
safest way to pick a local low.
The "Cloud Bounce" Setup:
1. Step 1: Trend Check (Kalman). Ensure the Kalman Cloud is 
Green (Fast line > Slow line) and the Velocity (slope) of the 
Slow line is pointing UP .
2. Step 2: The Dip. Wait for the price to drop into the Cloud or 
touch the Slow Kalman line. Do not buy yet—this  is like 
catching a falling knife.
3. Step 3: The Oracle Check (LSTM). Look at your LSTM 
model's prediction for the next 6-12 periods.
◦ Rule: If LSTM predicts "DOWN", ABORT. The support is 
likely to break.
◦ Rule: If LSTM predicts "UP" (or Price Target > Current 
Price), PROCEED.
4. Step 4: The Trigger (Price Action). Watch the candles 
reacting to the Kalman line. You need a Reversal Candle:
◦ Hammer / Pinbar: Long lower wick rejecting the Kalman 
line.
◦ Bullish Engulﬁng: A green candle that fully covers the 
previous red candle.

◦ Railroad Tracks: A red candle followed immediately by a 
green candle of equal size.
5. Execution: Enter the trade immediately on the close of the 
Reversal Candle.
Phase 3: Picking the Highs (Shorting Strategy)
This is the inverse of the buy strategy, used to pick tops or local 
highs.
1. Step 1: Trend Check. Ensure Kalman Cloud is Red and Slope 
is Down.
2. Step 2: The Rally. Wait for price to rally up into the Red 
Cloud.
3. Step 3: The Oracle Check. LSTM must predict "DOWN" or 
Lower Price Target.
4. Step 4: The Trigger. Look for a Shooting Star (long upper 
wick), Bearish Engulﬁng, or Dark Cloud Cover pattern 
occurring exactly at the Kalman line.
5. Execution: Short at the close of the trigger candle.
Phase 4: Closing the Trade (Exits)
Exiting is harder than entering. Use a "Dynamic Exit" approach 
combining these tools.
Scenario A: The Trend Follower (Maximize Proﬁt)
• Exit Rule: Stay in the trade as long as the price remains 
above the Slow Kalman Line.
• The Signal: Close the trade if a candle Closes on the 
opposite side of the Slow Kalman line (e.g., price closes 
below the Green cloud).
Scenario B: The Sniper (High Precision)
• Kalman Bands: Calculate the Standard Deviation of the price 
vs. the Kalman Filter (essentially Kalman Bollinger Bands).
• The Signal: If price hits the Upper Band (2 Standard 
Deviations above Kalman line) AND the LSTM predicts a 
reversal (or low conﬁdence in continued rise), Sell 
immediately. This often picks the exact top of a spike.
Scenario C: The LSTM Stop
• The Signal: If you are in a Long trade and the LSTM model 
suddenly ﬂips its prediction to "Strong Down" for the next 3 
periods, exit immediately, even if the Kalman trend is still 
intact. The LSTM is warning you of a breakdown before it 
shows on the chart.
Summary Checklist
Pro Tip: For risk management, use the LSTM Conﬁdence Score 
to size your bets.
• High Conﬁdence (>80%): Full Position Size.
• Medium Conﬁdence (60-80%): Half Position Size.
• Low Conﬁdence (<60%): No Trade.
